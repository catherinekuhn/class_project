    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    " Rivers, lakes and wetlands are generally known to be net sources of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere as they regularly emit CO2 and CH4, but much work remains quantifying spatial variability and sources, especially for large river systems highly impacted by human activities and infrastructure. The motivation behind this collaborative effort is to build an online, open-source tool for synthesizing remotely sensed watershed-related geospatial data with in situ field observations of water chemistry. Our ultimate goal is to automate data ingestion, fusion and exploration to help understand the patterns and controls driving changes in aquatic greenhouse gases to help inform regional and global carbon budgets. \n",

    "### Research Objectives/Science Driver\n",
    "\n",
    "- How does CO2 and CH4 vary spatially along large rivers? \n",
    "- How do carbon gas emission rates vary between two large rivers (the Amazon and the Mississippi)? \n",
    "- How can we visualize these data in a user-friendly interface accessible by researchers?\n",
    "- Can we use other variables to predict these trends in concentration?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Will's dataset (the Amazon, currently geocoded csv)\n",
    "- Kuhn's USGS dataset (Mississippi river)\n",
    "- Third Party Data: Earth Engine imagery\n",

    "### Design & Engineering Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inputs** Sensor data, shapefiles, earth engine datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outputs** Basic maps, scatterplots for relationships between variables, longitudinal spaghetti plots. All plots and maps are automated to consider user-defined options for variable choice and \n",
    "\n",
    "**Functions**:  \n",
    "1) Automated sensor data ingestion and cleaning into the Earth Engine platform using python wrappers  \n",
    "2) Spatial joins of .csv data to other river geospatial datasets  \n",
    "3) Map Visualization of basic concentrations of methane and carbon dioxide   \n",
    "4) Trend Exploration    \n",

    "    -spaghetti plots    \n",
    "5) Predictive Machine Learning to relate other geospatial variables to our gas concentrations  \n",

    "### Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "High dimensional fine-scale temporal and spatial sensor networks are increasing being deployed for earth system monitoring. However, many research effforts face technical challenges when trying to access and manipulation these large data streams. Our project has three specific use cases:  \n",
    "\n",
    "   -- Online, version controlled hosting of near-real time sensor data streams.  \n",
    "   -- A simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) tool for generating time series plots snd scatterplots out of      large datasets.  \n",
    "   -- Automated predictive testing to examine how other geochemical variables might impact gas concentrations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Third Party Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Earth Engine + associated datasets\n",
    "- USGS dataset\n",
    "- Raster packages: GDAL, rasterstats, geobricks, geopandas\n",

    "**Next Steps:** \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Add data files to the repo in both shapefile and .csv format  \n",
    "2) Test the viability of using Python EE -will it actually serve our needs?  \n",
    "3) Basic visualization of map data in Jupyter    \n",
    "4) Find more examples online of what people have done that we have  \n",
